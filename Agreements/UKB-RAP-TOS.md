# UK Biobank Research Analysis Platform Terms of Service ("UKB RAP TOS")

The Subscription Terms of Service for the DNAnexus platform at https://www.dnanexus.com/terms (the “DNAnexus TOS”), together with the terms set out below govern your use of the UK Biobank Research Analysis Platform (“UKB RAP”) and by clicking “agree” you (on behalf of yourself and the entity that you represent, collectively “you”) agree to abide by these terms (which may be amended or updated from time to time).

## Access and Use
1. In order to access the UKB RAP you must be a registered researcher on the UK Biobank Access Management System (“UKB AMS”) at https://bbams.ndph.ox.ac.uk/ams/.

2. In order to create a “Project” (as mentioned in section 3 of the DNAnexus TOS) you understand that you must be listed as a Principal Investigator or Collaborator on an approved UK Biobank research application (as defined by the UKB AMS) and have an account with the UKB AMS.

3. Your use of any data which you access in the UKB RAP must be in accordance with the Material Transfer Agreement (“MTA”) in place between your institution and UK Biobank and on which you are named as a Principal Investigator or Collaborator.

4. Your use of the UKB RAP must be for the purpose of an approved UK Biobank research application which is conducted using UKB data. Use of the UKB RAP for other purposes is prohibited.

5. Projects in the UKB RAP can be shared only between users on the same UKB AMS application.

6. Access to a Project may be removed automatically if you:

a. Breach the DNAnexus TOS, the UKB RAP TOS or the MTA; and/or

b. You are no longer listed as a Principal Investigator or Collaborator on the UKB AMS application associated with that Project;

and in such circumstances the Project may be deleted.

  1. The system may automatically access your Project (for example, in the form of a special service user called "UK Biobank Robot" [user: ukb.robot]) for the purposes of performing housekeeping such as dispensing and refreshing data.

  2. You agree to the system automatically enforcing participant withdrawals by removing or updating files associated with withdrawn individuals.

## Charging
9. If this is the first time you access UKB RAP, the system will create for you a "wallet" (i.e. a "personal billing account" which will appear as an organisation in the Org Admin menu), funded with an initial amount of 40GBP, courtesy of DNAnexus. This wallet is separate and unrelated to the "Trial Subscription" mentioned in section 2.8 of the DNAnexus TOS.

10. Many actions in UKB RAP, such as running analyses, storing your own data or analysis results, or downloading data, are chargeable. You agree to be charged the following rates for such compute, storage, and egress: [UKB Rate Card](https://www.dnanexus.com/ratecards/ukbiobank_ratecard_current) (which may be amended or updated from time to time).

11. You can use the aforementioned wallet to conduct chargeable activities and agree that DNAnexus may charge you and your wallet for such activities (and you agree to be responsible for all activities associated with your account). Should you consume the initial funds, you agree to either promptly provide billing information if you wish to continue using UKB RAP for chargeable activities, or to otherwise cease chargeable activities, including deleting any of your own data or analysis results that would cause storage charges. Failure to do so may result in the system disabling further access and automatically removing chargeable data.
